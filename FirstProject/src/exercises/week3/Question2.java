/**
 * Generate a random number and donâ€™t display that number user. Let the user
 * repeatedly guess a number until it is correct. The problem is to guess what
 * number a computer has in mind. You will write a program that randomly
 * generates an integer between 10 and 99, inclusive. The program prompts the
 * user to enter a number continuously until the number matches the randomly
 * generated number. For each user input, the program tells the user whether the
 * input is too low or too high, so the user can make the next guess
 * intelligently.
